Hi, my name is Yinhong Qin(覃崟弘 in Chinese). I am currently working with [Prof. Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/) from Tsinghua University on mobile manipulation and reinforcement learning. I am also working with [Prof. Wanxin Jin](https://wanxinjin.github.io/) from Arizona State University on contact-rich manipulation problems. Previously, I was a Research Assistant at MAPLE lab, Vanderbilt University, advised by [Prof. Jie Ying Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Wrq_fDEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and working closely with [Prof. Daniel Moyer](https://dcmoyer.github.io/) and [Prof. Soheil Kolouri](https://skolouri.github.io/). I completed my M.S. in Computer Engineering at New York University and B.Eng at Central South University, China. 

I also have internship experiences at [Intuitive Surigcal](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us), working on the FireFly feature for the da Vinci Surgical System and [Mech-Mind Robotics](https://www.mech-mind.com/), working on depth camera development.

I am highly interested in Robotics related research leveraging learning-based methods. Recently, I am interested in how could LLM assist with robot control as well as its safety concern. 

**Misc**: I am a [Tujia people/ 土家族](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tujia_people) and was born and raised in [Zhijiang/ 芷江](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhijiang_Dong_Autonomous_County), a peaceful town in western Hunan, where on Aug. 21st, 1945, the Japanese government signed the first surrounding treaty with the Republic of China, marking the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War during World War II.

<!-- I am also interested in contact-aware manipulation with visual and tactile information. -->

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
