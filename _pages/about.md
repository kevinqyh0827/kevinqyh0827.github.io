Hi, my name is Yinhong Qin. I am currently a Research Assistant at MAPLE lab, Vanderbilt University, advised by Prof. Jie Ying Wu. I am also working closely with [Prof. Daniel Moyer](https://dcmoyer.github.io/) and [Prof. Soheil Kolouri](https://skolouri.github.io/). Previously, I received my M.S. in Computer Engineering at New York University and B.Eng at Central South University, China. Besides, I also have internship experiences at [Intuitive Surigcal](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us), working on the FireFly feature for da Vinci Surgical System (2022 Summer) and [Mech-Mind Robotics](https://www.mech-mind.com/), working on depth camera development (2020-2021).

I am highly interested in Robotics related research leveraging learning-based methods. Recently, I am interested in how could LLM assist with robot control as well as its safety concern. 

<!-- I am also interested in contact-aware manipulation with visual and tactile information. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `assets/img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
